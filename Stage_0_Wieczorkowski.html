   <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The world wide web is made up of computers that communicate with each other. 
       HTML (<em>hyper-text markup language</em>) is the main type of document on the web.
       All pages have HTML.  HTML is a file just like an image, document, or mp3.
       You as the user interface with a computer that uses the internet to communicate with 
       servers that are computers that are optimized to store files.  
       HTTP is the protocol used to communicate with servers by way of a browser like 
       Mozilla Firefox.  
    </p>
    
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>HTML markup describes what the text looks like and how it is arranges on the page.
      One of the components within HTML code is the "<b>tag</b>."   An element 
      is the tag along with the contents.  There are also HTML attributes like "href"
      or "src" which are used for links and images, respectively.  Here is a link to <a href="codepen.io">codepen</a>
      .  Here is an inline image <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Ash_Tree_-_geograph.org.uk_-_590710.jpg" alt="tree">
      </p>
    
    <h3>Whitespace</h3>
    <p>Whitespace is all treated the same       no matter how many    spaces
      or    
      
      
      returns in the line.  
    </p>
    
    <h3>Void Tags</h3>
    Void tags do not have a closing tag.  One example is the "br" tage which
    which is also classified as an inline tage.  
    
    <h3>Inline vs. Block Elements</h3>
    The "br" tag just ends the line.
    The "p" tage is a block element that creates an invisible box  around te element
    that can be defined by length and width
    
    <h3>Computer Language</h3>
    Computers are not smart and must be told exactly what to do.  Once one
    understands the proper language to communicate with the computer, one can
    tell it exactly what to do when following the rules that the computer
    understands.
